# Contributing Guidelines
 
Hi everyone, while this project is something I'm going to be doing in the (little) spare time I have, I am more than happy for others to contribute if this is something that you are interested in and would like to help me bring some history back into modern development!

## Guidelines

1. Any modifications, enhancements or changes of any kind to the functionality of dot-net-engima must be historically accurate and be well documented by reliable sources.
2. Any changes must be done on a seperate branch and requested to be pulled into the main branch through a well explained pull request.
3. Any commits must have sufficiently well described titles and descriptions, so you can easily distinguish what modifications have been made without explicit review of the code changes.
4. Commits should be small and modular, so they can be easily reverted/applied if changes need to be made in the future.
5. Any code written should match modern development standards which includes things like unit/integration tests, object-oriented design and self-documenting code.

## Notes

This is my first open source project, so if any contributors have any suggestions on changes I can make to improve the collaboration process on this project please let me know. Happy Coding :)

Mike.
